The folder containing the laravel project is blog.inside apache public folder.


Error. I  forbidden error
Solution: I copied all the content of the public folder from the blog which is a laravel project,(Note cut or deleting the public folder was generating an error) to the root of apache public folder. In this case it was var/www/html/public/ then I open the index file and change this line to include the
folder part
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/blog/bootstrap/app.php';
require __DIR__.'/blog/vendor/autoload.php';

*******This code was run to remove the permission error
chmod -Rf 0777 /var/www/html/public/blog/bootstrap/cache
chmod -Rf 0777 /var/www/html/public/blog/storage
